Imagine this Situation…

- You are a Sales Controller working at the headquarters of Urban Creations.
- Urban Creations owns 4 companies. 2 are in the USA and 2 are in Europe.
- At the end of each month you receive system extracts for each company that covers some key sales & customer parameters.
- Based on this data, you need to create the following Monthly Reports:
• An interactive Pivot based regional report for the regional managers of USA and Europe
• A hard coded regional overview report for top management
- In addition to this, you need to generate a CSV file of all the data to be loaded to your central ERP system for year-to-date reporting.

Your Challenge

1. There are two USA and two European companies. You need to get all the information in one place.
2. The data extract you receive uses codes. The managers want to see the description and not the code.
3. You need to combine the data for each region and create a separate Excel report for it.
4. Regional managers would like to have Pivot based reports so they can slice and dice through the information (macro free workbook).
5. Top management would like to have a one-pager report that is hardcoded (macro free workbook).
6. You need to split each region to its own file. European Regional managers should not see the US data
7. You need to get all the data in CSV format and save it on the directory.
8. Since these are a lot of tasks, and data for each company might come in at different points, you'd like to keep track 
of which tasks you've already completed.


Aim of the tool

There is a lot of copying, pasting, looking up values from master data (i.e. mapping codes to get descriptions). 
All of this will cost you a lot of time if done manually (possibly around 3 hours - plus data changes are not uncommon)
Sometimes you have to repeat the whole process because wrong data was sent;
… and sometimes you might make mistakes…. (after all the task is a bit boring…)


The tool should automate the entire process to 2 minutes - even with data changes.

Time savings: 3 plus hours
Frustration because data was updated after sending (you had to repeat the process): Eliminated
Possibility of manual mistakes due to boredom: Eliminated
